//! LOCAL FORK: this module was the Rudderstack telemetry pipeline. All of it went:
//! `TelemetryApi`, `TelemetryCollector`, the `TelemetryEvent` enum and its ~6,500 lines of
//! payload types, the Rudder message model, the payload secret redaction, and the
//! `send_telemetry_*` macros.
//!
//! What remains are the plain provenance tags below. Despite living here they were never
//! telemetry plumbing: each one is a payload field on a kept action or event type
//! (`WorkspaceAction`, `TerminalAction`, `pane_group::Event`, `terminal::Event`,
//! `OpenLaunchConfigArg`, `PromptSuggestionResolution`) or a parameter on a kept function,
//! recording which piece of UI initiated an action. Deleting them would mean unpicking
//! those enums across the terminal, workspace and pane-group views.
//!
//! The module path is deliberately unchanged so the ~20 files that import these names do
//! not have to move. Renaming it to something honest (`app/src/action_source.rs`) is a
//! mechanical follow-up once the tree is green again.
