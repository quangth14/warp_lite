//! Warp UI Components module contains functions and structs that implement our internal components
//! used for the apps design (our buttons with styling, headers and panels etc.) as well definition
//! of colors (aka blended colors from the figma designs derived from Warp theme) and icons used

// the notebook details bar, the env var collection view and the workflow argument modal) dropped
// their rows with the panel, leaving the module with no callers.
